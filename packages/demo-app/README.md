# Alice contracts demo app

We created a demo app so you can interact and test the smart contracts in a visual
environment rather than hacking console scripts.

## Installation

No additional actions besides the common monorepo installation procedure are
needed.


## Running

This app uses a local Ganache instance, so first start one using:

```
yarn ganache-cli -a 100
```

Then, you can run the server like this:

```
yarn dev
```

The app should be now available at http://localhost:8080/.
