        Dear {{user.firstName}},<br/><br/>
        Thank you for supporting the "{{project.title}}" project run by {{project.charity.name}}.
        You'll find the details of your donation below.

      <h2>Remember</h2>

      <p>
        You have just made a conditional donation that will be grouped with others to pay for one or
        more project goals achieved by your charity.
        We'll let you know as soon as that happens, and you can always check the status of your donation
        by visiting "My Impact".
      </p>

        Please note that this is not a tax receipt, due to the conditional nature of your donation.
        If you opted to add Gift Aid, it has not yet been applied. You will receive a tax receipt
        only once your gift is paid to the charity. If the charity doesn't achieve the goals necessary
        to receive your donation, in whole or in part, within the next 9 months,
        you will be given the option to get a refund for the outstanding balance.
      </p>
