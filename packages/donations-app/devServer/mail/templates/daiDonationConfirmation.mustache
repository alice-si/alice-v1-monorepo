        Please note that this is not a tax receipt, due to the conditional nature of your donation.
        If you opted to add Gift Aid, it has not yet been applied. You will receive a tax receipt
        only once your gift is paid to the charity. If the charity doesn't achieve the goals necessary
        to receive your donation, in whole or in part, within the next 9 months,
        you will be given the option to get a refund for the outstanding balance.
